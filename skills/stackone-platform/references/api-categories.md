# StackOne API

StackOne exposes two API surfaces:

## Actions API (primary)

The Actions API provides access to 10,000+ provider-specific actions across 200+ connectors. Actions are executed via a single endpoint:

```
POST https://api.stackone.com/actions/rpc
```

Actions are named `{provider}_{operation}_{entity}` (e.g., `bamboohr_list_employees`, `salesforce_get_contact`).

For the full Actions API reference, fetch:
`https://docs.stackone.com/platform/api-reference/actions/make-an-rpc-call-to-an-action`

To discover available actions for a provider, fetch:
`https://docs.stackone.com/connectors/introduction`

## Platform API

The Platform API handles account management, not data operations:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /accounts` | List linked accounts |
| `GET /accounts/{id}` | Get a specific linked account |
| `POST /connect_sessions` | Create a connect session for account linking |

For the full Platform API reference, fetch:
